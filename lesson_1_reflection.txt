How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using diff command

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    Using git log

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I decide when I do a commit (when it's has sense to me)
Cons: If for some reason I forget to do a commit it will be a big problem

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git works with multiples files and all of them have relation each other, while Google Docs contain one file and is not related with others 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Command log: I can use to see how many commits I did
Command diff is to compare between two of them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Sure, I could break down my project when I have important feature added to it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My own projects, I was thinking to use it also with personal files
