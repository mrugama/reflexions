When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In order to work in collaborative team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid changes you don't want to affect your local environment 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: In order to create a copy of one repository on Github without have to clone and push it in your Github account by doing forks you can clone online between two different accounts.
Clones: When you want to work locally with a project on Github.
Branches: When you want to separates different environments in your local git 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is because I can identify the difference between my last change and my last known state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I can't imagine working without git or GitHub. The easy part is I am able to go back in my previous commits and can create different branches.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    We want to make different branches when we are working in a test environment or creating a new feature in our app and we are pretty sure the changes are what we want to we merge into our master branch.
